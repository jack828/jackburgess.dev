This is a statically generated site powered by Next.js, designed to be deployed to any static site host you like.

Styling is done using [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) as it is nice and simple - and Javascript free. I recommend it highly if you're looking for something that isn't Bootstrap.

The site is hosted on [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) because it is FAST.

I'm happy to accept pull requests for the tools & blog posts. Also accepting ideas for posts. Just let me know what you want!
