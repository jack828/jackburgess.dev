# IDEAS

Transmission influxDB exporter with my package?

"why i chose to add 1,000+ eslint rules"

Makes it feel like the same person writing the code
helps enforce moving away from buggy,legacy behaviour like isNan https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN#description
the one about unicode regex maybe
