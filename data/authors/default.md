I am a Senior Software Engineer employed at [Clock Limited](https://www.clock.co.uk/).

In my spare time I love trying to work on my hobbies - this could be my photography, embedded projects, or writing blogs on my personal website (this one!!).
When at work, I like to try and give back to the open-source community by fixing typos in documentation, or filing exemplary bug reports.

I'm based in the UK - the sunny part.<sup>_[citation needed]_</sup>
