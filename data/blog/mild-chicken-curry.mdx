A delicious chicken curry, for those that are afraid of spicy pain flavour (or that cannot eat spicy foods because of angry guts).

This is a modification of a [BBC goodFOOD recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-chicken-curry).

The main changes are powdered or dried herbs, and chicken breast. I've also linked the exact spices I use, since there's no end to the variety and I'll probably forget.

This is a continuation of the random [cooking](/tags/cooking) themed posts.

Also, I'd encourage you to watch this _fantastic_ and absolutely _beautifully_ made video by [Answer in Progress](https://www.youtube.com/@answerinprogress), who try and answer the question of "what even is a curry?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L16xxxVDGGo

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp sunflower oil
- 500g chicken breast
- 1 medium onion
- 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
- 1/2 tsp dried ginger
- 3 tbsp [mild spice paste](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/313011042)
- 400g can chopped tomatoes or 500g passata
- 100g Greek yoghurt
- 1/2 tsp dried coriander

For your sides, I'd recommend some [garlic and coriander naan breads](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/305733449) and some easy [boil in the bag rice](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/251442835).

## Method

Cooking time: 1 hour.

1. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat.

1. Dice the onion (or thin strips, if you prefer), and fry in the oil with a pinch of salt for 8-10 minutes, or until the onion goes golden brown and sticky.

1. Add the crushed garlic and ginger, and saut√© for another minute.

1. Meanwhile, chop the chicken into 2-3cm chunks. Add to the pan and fry for about 5 minutes until no pink is visible.

1. Add the spice paste and tomatoes with 250ml of water.

1. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer uncovered for 25-30 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Then, stir through the yoghurt and coriander.

1. Meanwhile the curry is simmering, (remember to stir frequently) cook the rice according to the instructions.

1. Blast the naan in the air fryer and dig in!
