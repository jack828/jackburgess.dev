A pretty short one this time.

I've owned (and used) a [CyberPower BR700ELCD-UK](https://www.cyberpower.com/uk/en/product/sku/br700elcd-uk) for a long time - but never managed to get the connection to TrueNAS working.

Until I actually sat down and tried again! So this is just a (hopefully) [google-able](https://duckduckgo.com) guide to get it working for others.

It was pretty straightforward, although I had to find the right teeny tiny fragments of information over the years to finally get it in place.

One key piece of information was that TrueNAS uses Network UPS Tools (NUT), which does support the UPS[^1]!

These instructions will be for TrueNAS SCALE 23.10 - future versions may look different!

1. Edit the settings for UPS under `System Settings` -> `Services` -> `UPS`

2. Set it up as shown

The main changes from defaults are:

- Monitor User: `ups` (previously, this was `upsmon`)
- Driver: `Cyber Power Systems ups 2 CP900AVR (usbhid-ups)`
  - Allegedly[^2], any `ups 2` version using `usbhid-ups` should work. I tried to find the exact model, but couldn't, so I went with the one shown.
- Port or Hostname: `auto`
  - Set it to `auto` to prevent having to faff around when it inevitably changes.
- The shutdown options are completely up to you. Although, I would err on the side of caution with timings, to account for degredation of the battery.
- Auxiliary Parameters (ups.conf): Add `pollinterval = 15`
  - Allegedly[^3], the UPS requires interaction more frequently then the default, or you'll continually see disconnection loops.

Don't forget to save.

3. Enable the UPS service

4. Check that it is recognised ok

SSH in to your server, and run `upsc ups@localhost`. You should see UPS statistics.

5. Turn off the power to the UPS, and verify that it shuts down safely.
