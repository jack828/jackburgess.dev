# Preamble

If you’ve landed here, hello! It seems that you too want to make the switch from TrueNAS Core to Scale.

There are many reasons for and against it, and I won’t go into them here. At the end of the day, when all’s said and done...you know what I mean?[^1]

I also won’t go into the exact migration process for the OS itself - you can do it all through the UI. But make sure you have backups of everything!

I’ll primarily be going over the app migrations for my jails into Docker container versions, keeping as much data as possible.

These will be a combination of semi-rough and detailed notes, so I hope they’re helpful.

# But first

I’d create a new dataset for your container data to live. Gradually, we’ll copy more and more data out of the old `iocage` dataset into this one. It’s good to keep a copy so we can start fresh.

I went with a dataset called `apps`, so I’ll be using commands referencing that, in my pool `tank`: `/mnt/tank/apps`.

# Plex

The configuration can be found here:

```
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/<jailname>/root/usr/local/plexdata/Plex\ Media\ Server/
```

Where `<jailname>` is your jail - mine was `plex`.

Copy this folder into your app dataset:

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/tank/apps/plex/config/Library/Application\ Support/
cp -Rip /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/plex/root/usr/local/plexdata/Plex\ Media\ Server/ /mnt/tank/apps/plex/config/Library/Application\ Support/
chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/tank/apps/plex/config/
```

When installing the Plex app, under `Storage` -> `Config Volume`, you need to set it to the above path `/mnt/tank/apps/plex/config`

I have my media setup like so:

```
/mnt/tank/movies
/mnt/tank/tvshows
/mnt/tank/spanish/movies
/mnt/tank/spanish/tvshows
```

With these directories previously being mounted on the container in similar (but not identical) paths:

```
/mnt/movies
/mnt/tvshows
/mnt/spanish/movies
/mnt/spanish/tvshows
```

I went this route since I didn’t particularly want Plex to have _complete_ access to the whole pool. We can achieve the same structure in the Docker version.

Under the `Config Volume`, there’s a button to add `Plex Extra Host Path Volumes`. Click it, and put the corresponding paths as above to rebuild the required structure.

**NOTE:** I had issues with the official TrueNAS Plex app (obviously) with SMB shares and stuff, so I had to disable the SMB share that was causing the issue.

# Transmission

For me, configuration and existing torrents can be found here:

```
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/<jailname>/root/usr/local/etc/transmission/home/
```

Where `<jailname>` is your jail - mine was `transmission`.

Copy this folder into your app dataset:

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/tank/apps/transmission/
cp -Rip /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/usr/local/etc/transmission/home /mnt/tank/apps/transmission/config
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/apps/transmission/config/
```

When installing the Transmission app, under `Storage Configuration` -> `Transmission Config Storage`, you need to set it to the above path `/mnt/tank/apps/transmission/config`

Leave `Complete Downloads Storage` and `Incomplete Downloads Storage` as they are - we’ll be mounting our own directories to avoid having to reconfigure the torrents.

Under `Additional Storage`, add a Host Path mount option for your download location. For me, it was `/mnt/tank/torrents` to be mounted as `/mnt/torrents`

> The reason we’re not using the option for download location is that the internal torrent files (and resume files) reference absolute paths - we need to keep these the same so we don’t have to migrate them.

The web UI port is different in this app - change it if you want the old behaviour (8081).

You can start the container now and see if it works with your previous config - and that your torrents are all there. `Verify local files` on one of them to make sure everything is hunky-dory.

# Grafana + InfluxDB

## Grafana

This is where things get a little trickier. I’ve documented how to set up both these services in the past to capture metrics from TrueNAS, both [on this blog](/blog/truenas-grafana-influxdb-metrics) and originally on the [TrueNAS forum](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/guide-to-setting-up-grafana-influxdb-metrics.88943/)[^2].

Therefore these steps assume you’re using the same setup - so if not, adjust to taste.

We’ll start with Grafana - as the app is available from the official TrueNAS Chart. At the time of writing this, it’s version 10 - a huge jump from my v7 Core setup.

I had the database here:

```
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/<jailname>/root/var/db/grafana/grafana.db
```

Where `<jailname>` is your jail - mine was `transmission`.

Copy this file into your app dataset:

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/tank/apps/grafana/
cp -Rip /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/grafana/root/var/db/grafana/grafana.db /mnt/tank/apps/grafana/
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/apps/grafana/
```

Under `Additional Environment Variables`, add the following:

- `GF_DATABASE_PATH` - `/mnt/grafana/grafana.db`

Under `Additional Storage`, add a Host Path mount option for your app data location. I used `/mnt/tank/apps/grafana` to be mounted as `/mnt/grafana`

Now - I had problems with the SQLite database, with log messages saying "database is locked". If your googling leads you nowhere, try adding the environment variable `GF_DATABASE_WAF=true`.

## InfluxDB

I had an old version of InfluxDB installed from when I created the guide. Therefore, I’m just going to run with the same one - 1.8.0.

Unfortunately, it’s not available in the official chart (or Truecharts)[^3], so we’ll have to go with Docker Compose.

1. Prepare your InfluxDB data:

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/
cp -Rip /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/grafana/root/usr/local/etc/influxd.conf /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/
cp -Rip /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/grafana/root/var/db/influxdb /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/db
mv /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/influxd.conf /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/influxdb.conf
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/influxdb.conf /mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/db
```

**_NOTE:_** It seemed that for me, `influxd.conf` worked previously, but it now expects it to be called `influxdb.conf`.

2. In the `Apps` section, click `Launch Docker Image`:

- Application Name: `influxdb`
- Image Repository: `influxdb`
- Image Tag: `1.8`
- Networking -> Add External Interface
  - Select your interface (I only have one)
  - IPAM Type: `Static IP`
    - 192.168.1.8/24 (or your preference)
  - Add static route
    - Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
    - Gateway: `192.168.1.1` (or your gateway)
- Storage -> Add Host Path Volumes
  - Host Path: `/mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/db`
  - Mount Path: `/var/db/influxdb`
  - Host Path: `/mnt/tank/apps/influxdb/influxdb.conf`
  - Mount Path: `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`

3. Restart Grafana

4. You’ll need to modify the data sources to the IP above. Alternatively, I found a [post](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/graphite-report-to-influxdb-docker-container-how-to-get-reachable-static-address.104011/) that used the internal name for the container `http://influxdb-ix-chart.ix-influxdb.svc.cluster.local.:8086` which worked for me.

> Also, note that the Scale team decided to remove the graphite metric collection - see Jira tickets [NAS-123668](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123668) and [NAS-123098](https://ixsystems.atlassian.net/browse/NAS-123098). So, yay. That’s never coming back!

# Sonarr

Ah, the \*arr[^5] suite of applications. Perfect for the Linux ISO power collector. I didn’t want to spend too much time here - and luckily, I found that it automatically backs up its config!

You can find your backups using a command like so:

```
find /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/ -iname '*sonarr*'
```

I had many files in the output - most importantly, these:

```
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/usr/local/sonarr/sonarr.db
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/usr/local/sonarr/Backups/scheduled/sonarr_backup_v3.0.9.1549_2023.10.18_22.07.49.zip
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/usr/local/sonarr/Backups/scheduled/sonarr_backup_v3.0.9.1549_2023.10.04_22.07.03.zip
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/usr/local/sonarr/Backups/scheduled/sonarr_backup_v3.0.9.1549_2023.10.11_22.07.23.zip
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/transmission/root/usr/local/sonarr/Backups/scheduled/sonarr_backup_v3.0.9.1549_2023.10.25_22.08.16.zip
```

Setup a folder for Sonarr to use:

```sh
mkdir -p /mnt/tank/apps/sonarr/
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/apps/sonarr/
```

And add the Sonarr app to your system. Under `Sonarr Config Storage`, change it to Host Path and put `/mnt/tank/apps/sonarr`.

Add your relevant additional mounts here too, for access to your TV Shows.

Once deployed and active, open the web portal and go to `Settings` -> `Backup` -> `Restore Backup` (in the navbar). Use the latest backup you found.

Give it a moment to finish, and then make sure you have no further alerts in Sonarr. I had to amend the port used for Transmission, but otherwise, it appeared fine.

This was arguably the easiest. Kudos to Sonarr developers!

# Jackett

I had a dedicated jail for this previously, but I couldn’t tell you why. I’ll keep it short and sweet from now on, you should know what we are doing by now.

Config here:

```
/mnt/tank/iocage/jails/jackett/root/usr/local/jackett/
```

Make it a home: (and delete some logs, we don’t need them)

```sh
mkdir /mnt/tank/apps/jackett/
cp -Rip /mnt/tank/iocage/jails/jackett/root/usr/local/jackett /mnt/tank/apps/jackett/Jackett
rm /mnt/tank/apps/jackett/Jackett/log*.txt
chown -R 568:568 /mnt/tank/apps/jackett
```

You’ll need to add the Truecharts Catalog to your installation - this is [easy to do](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/#adding-truecharts).

Select the Jackett application. Under `App Config Storage`, change to Host Path, and set it to `/mnt/tank/apps/jackett`

Save and start!

Thank you to Daulton for documenting [Jackett on FreeBSD](https://daulton.ca/2018/12/jackett-on-freebsd/) which helped me find the config directory.

> Note: I actually had to deprecate (read: abandon) Jackett due to a recurring `System.InsufficientExecutionStackException` error. This was not unique to my system nor to the version of Jackett I was running. It’s a shame, to be honest!

# End

That’s all the programs I had running pre-migration. I hope this helped!

[^2]: I’m amazed at the amount of engagement that post got. I didn’t have my notifications set up correctly, so I unfortunately let it fall off my radar!
[^3]: Probably because there are many other "better" time series databases out there. However, I like and have bought into Influx - it works on my machine™
[^4]: And before you say it, I know that you shouldn’t use it like that / it’s not supported / blah / blah / blah - I just want it to work!
