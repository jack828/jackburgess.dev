## Author's note

This is a recreation of my final project completed as part of my degree at the University of Hertfordshire.

I wrote this report with blood, sweat, caffeine, and many tears, from start to finish. I'm immortalising and sharing it with you because it represents a lot more than £50,000+ of student loans[^1]. It represents a determination to succeed, despite the extracurricular challenges I was facing at the time.

It was a rocky start - the supervisor I wanted to have in the beginning had agreed to work with me, but due to unforeseen circumstances we had to discontinue our partnership at a crucial stage of the project. Thanks to the staff at the university my replacement supervisor was more than capable of instilling the confidence and providing the oversight I needed to complete the project to an incredible standard.

With this finishing off four years of education, I was awarded a **1<sup>st</sup> Class BSc with Honours in Computer Science (Software Engineering)** in June of 2019.

I'm going to leave it as close to the original as I can - no additional paragraphs, explanations, typos. Some features just aren't compatible with this website, or loose their effectiveness through a split medium.

You can navigate this by using the navigation at the bottom of posts.

[^1]: If you're not familiar with university in the UK - this is basically a 9% graduate tax that expires after 30 years. No biggie. Unless you look at the interest rates.
