# Matomo Analytics

I had looked high and low for an analytics platform that wasn’t evil or sold my user’s data. There are not many options in that space - and even fewer still that offer free options.

[Matomo](https://matomo.org/) fills that gap with a powerful alternative, that you can self-host for free!

Without further ado, let’s jump straight into it. We’ll be setting it up on a Raspberry Pi (any server will do, in theory), and using a Cloudflare Tunnel for access via the internet.

We’ll also be configuring Matomo to work around adblockers. As Matomo is privacy-first, I think this is more than acceptable to do.

There are some prerequisites before we can begin.

You will need:

- Somewhere to host it all, e.g. Raspberry Pi, etc. with Docker and Docker Compose set up
- A domain using Cloudflare’s DNS
- Zero Trust set up (as in, no tutorial to complete - it’s free)
- An idea for your analytics subdomain, e.g. `stats.example.com`

And don’t worry. Everything used here is completely free!

## Docker Compose

My favourite addition to the developer ecosystem - Docker Compose. Now we can share configuration files that (hopefully) work straight away on other people’s machines.

In our compose file we’ll have three containers - Matomo, MariaDB, and Cloudflare Tunnel.

```yaml:docker-compose.yaml {18}
version: '3.8'
services:
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: cloudflared
    network_mode: 'host'
    command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run
    env_file: ./secrets/cloudflared.env
    restart: unless-stopped

  matomo:
    container_name: matomo
    image: matomo
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    environment:
      - MATOMO_DATABASE_HOST=matomo_db
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=stats.example.com
    env_file:
      - ./secrets/matomo.env
    depends_on:
      - matomo_db
    restart: unless-stopped

  matomo_db:
    container_name: matomo_db
    image: mariadb
    command: --max-allowed-packet=64MB
    volumes:
      - /data:/var/lib/mysql
    env_file:
      - ./secrets/matomo.env
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Don’t forget to create your secrets file:

```sh:./secrets/matomo.db
MYSQL_PASSWORD=something_secret_please
MYSQL_DATABASE=matomo
MYSQL_USER=matomo
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=something_else_secret_please

MATOMO_DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql
MATOMO_DATABASE_TABLES_PREFIX=matomo_
MATOMO_DATABASE_USERNAME=matomo
MATOMO_DATABASE_PASSWORD=
MATOMO_DATABASE_DBNAME=matomo
```

**_Make sure you replace the MYSQL_PASSWORD variable with something secure!!_**

Remember to set your `VIRTUAL_HOST` variable to your desired analytics domain.

You can generate a short random string using `openssl rand -base64 16`.

Now we can start up the containers with `docker compose up -d`.

## Zero Trust

Moving onto how we’ll access this instance from the internet - without putting our poor Pi’s IP into the wild - we’ll use Cloudflare’s Zero Trust Tunnels feature.

This guide assumes you’ve got Zero Trust setup, and a domain controlled in Cloudflare - please see other guides for this if you aren’t there yet.

In the Zero Trust dashboard, go to `Networks` -> `Tunnels`, and create a new tunnel.

Chose `cloudflared` as the connector, and a good name for it (like `test-001`).

You’ll be given installation instructions. Run back to where your `docker-compose.yaml` file is and add a new secrets file:

```sh:./secrets/cloudflared.env
TUNNEL_TOKEN=eyJhIjo.....
```

Place your token here, and bring the container up `docker compose up -d`. You should see the connector healthy in the dashboard.

In the dashboard, you will be asked how to route traffic to the tunnel. Using the `Public Hostnames` option, set it up like so:

Public Hostname

- Subdomain: `metrics`
- Domain: `<your CF domain>`
- Path: (blank)

Service

- Type: `http`
- URL: `localhost:8080`

(Feel free to change as you need. I avoided `metrics` or `matomo` for the domain, as aggressive adblockers will intercept!)

Save. You should be able to visit Matomo on your new subdomain!

## Matomo

The setup for Matomo is very straightforward. Make sure the system check looks good.

On the Database Setup screen, set the `Password` field to the same as you set for `MYSQL_PASSWORD`. Everything else should be pre-filled.

With the database initialised, pick something for the superuser’s login details. Just make sure you remember them.

> These need to be secure, as this endpoint will be public!

Now let’s set up our first website. Fill the fields as appropriate, and hit next. You’ll be given your Matomo tracking snippet - place it into your website, and you should start to see analytics come into Matomo!

## Ublock Blocker

Fairly controversial, yes, but if you get as few visitors to your site as I do, every little helps.

There’s no need to do this step if you don’t want to - entirely up to you.

We’ll need to do two things here:

- Re-write requests to Matomo’s scripts
- Re-write requests to Matomo’s tracker endpoint

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your Matomo domain. You need the page with the long sidebar that includes things like "DNS" and "Rules".

Go into the `Rules` -> `Transform Rules` and create a new `Rewrite URL` rule.

Fill it out as follows:

- Name: `Matomo`
- If: `Custom filter expression`
- On the section `When incoming requests match`, click the `Edit expression` link to get the builder.
- Put the value `(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/moomoo.js")) or (starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/moomoo.php"))`

I’ve gone with `moomoo.js` because why not.

- `Then` -> `Path` -> `Rewrite to...` - select `Dynamic` and put this monster:

```
concat("/matomo", substring(http.request.uri.path, 7))
```

What this does is the following:

1. With `http.request.uri.path` equaling `/moomoo.js` (or `.php`)
1. Give the substring starting from index 7 (the length of "/moomoo") = `.js`
1. Concatenate with the string `"/matomo"` = `/matomo.js`

It would have been ideal to use `regex_replace`, but unfortunately, that is only available on enterprise plans.

Save and deploy the rule. You should be able to immediately test it by visiting `https://stats.yourdomain/moomoo.js` - you should get the Matomo tracking code!

Now we can go back to our tracking snippet:

```html
<!-- Matomo -->
<script>
  var _paq = (window._paq = window._paq || [])
  _paq.push(['disableCookies'])
  _paq.push(['trackPageView'])
  _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking'])
  _paq.push(['enableHeartBeatTimer'])
  ;(function () {
    var u = '//stats.example.com/'
    _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u + 'matomo.php'])
    _paq.push(['setSiteId', 'YOUR_MATOMO_SITE_ID'])
    var d = document,
      g = d.createElement('script'),
      s = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]
    g.async = true
    g.src = u + 'matomo.js'
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s)
  })()
</script>
<!-- End Matomo Code -->
```

Make some changes:

```html {8,11,17}
<!-- Matomo -->
<script>
  var _paq = (window._paq = window._paq || [])
  _paq.push(['disableCookies'])
  _paq.push(['trackPageView'])
  _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking'])
  _paq.push(['enableHeartBeatTimer'])
  _paq.push(['setRequestMethod', 'POST'])
  ;(function () {
    var u = '//stats.example.com/'
    _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u + 'moomoo.php'])
    _paq.push(['setSiteId', 'YOUR_MATOMO_SITE_ID'])
    var d = document,
      g = d.createElement('script'),
      s = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]
    g.async = true
    g.src = u + 'moomoo.js'
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s)
  })()
</script>
<!-- End Matomo Code -->
```

Here we set the request method to POST (apparently that works around some adblock mechanisms), and amend the PHP/JS scripts to our newly named `moomoo` version.

That’s it! You’re done. You should be capturing all the metrics now.
